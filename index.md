# Project Name Here
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

# First Milestone
My first milestone is the assembly of my planters pcb, sensor, speaker and body. The first thing I did was assemble my pcb, which entalied plugging in some ribbon cables. My second process was attaching my sensor to a mounting mechanism and plugging in the cable that would attach to the pcb. I then assembled my planters body, which was 3d printed. I first attached the pot to the drip tray, then attached it to the housing. Then, I attached my sensor to the assembled body and attacehd the pcb and screen to the body. I then attached the back part to finish the physical aspect of this project.

The assembly was pretty straight forward and simple, except attaching the speaker cable to the pcb. The cable was exteremly short and was therefore very tense when attaching. It was also a very small and fragile cable, which would be very easy to break. My next step is programing the software for the planter.

# Completion Of Starter Project
My first milestone is the completion of my starter project, that being the useless box. The function of the box is essentially to have no function (except perhaps pinching the user), as no items can be taken out or placed inside it. The box does this by contaning a switch that when flipped, causes a mechanical arm to be raised which hits the switch, lowering the arm and closing the box. The basic components of the box are the box itself, a pcb, a motor and a plastic arm. I had an issue while soldering components to the pcb which caused multiple short circuits. After I replaced the pcb, I had an issue with my motor, where it wasn't generationg enough torque to push the switch. I fixed this by replacing the motor. However, after doing this, I found that the motor was too powerful, causing the lid of the box to stay open. I solved this by putting some tape on the sides of the hinge.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
